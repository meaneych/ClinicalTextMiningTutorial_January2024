Clinical Text Mining: A Tutorial of Some Tools in R/Python

Author: Christopher Meaney
Date: January 2024

Healthcare systems are collecting increasing large quantities of digital information on their patients; and much of the information generated exists in clinical text format. The objective of this talk/tutorial is to introduce several computational tools and statistical models commonly encountered in clinical text mining research. The talk wi.ill begin by introducing how text/string data (digital character sequences) are stored in R/Python, and how they might be manipulated using pattern matching and regular expression tools. The talk will introduce the core problem of tokenization, i.e. splitting input digital character sequences into sets of words/tokens. Next, we will introduce  
statistical semantic models (document term matrices, term co-occurrence matrices, etc.) and their respective role in several NLP problems (e.g. supervised document classification, unsupervised topic extraction and document clustering, unsupervised token/word clustering). Finally, the talk will introduce large language models (LLMs), as a general purpose and performant model across a variety of core NLP talks (with particular application to clinical text deidentification, cast as a named entity recognition problem). Jupyter notebooks (using either R/Python kernels) will be provided to illustrate computational tools and statistical models introduced in the talk, and are available at the following URL: https://github.com/meaneych/ClinicalTextMiningTutorial_January2024
